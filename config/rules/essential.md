# Essential Rules

1. **Read first** - Read related files before making changes
2. **Keep small** - Tasks, commits, PRs should be minimal
3. **Validate inputs** - Validate all external inputs
4. **No premature abstraction** - Don't abstract until needed

## Code Thresholds

| Item | Limit |
|------|-------|
| File size | ≤ 300 LOC |
| Function length | ≤ 50 LOC |
| Parameters | ≤ 5 |
| Cyclomatic complexity | ≤ 10 |
